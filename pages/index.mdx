# Introduction üëã

Welcome to the PhotoProX Docs! This is the offical documentation for PhotoProX.

## What is PhotoProX?

PhotoProX is a a **modern**, **user-friendly** and **flexible** web based photo editor that is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [PixiJS](https://pixijs.com/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Furthermore, it is open source, meaning you can use it for free and contribute to the project.

## The Goal of PhotoProX üòÄ

Today, most photo editors have amazing features but are either too expensive or too complex to use. PhotoProX aims to solve this problem by providing a modern, user-friendly and flexible photo editor that is easy and free to use.

Furthermore, learning is a key part of the PhotoProX project. We aim to provide a platform where anyone can learn various topics in software development, the science of photo editing, and the overall beauty of what can be achieved with code and creativity.

## Reading the Docs

The PhotoProX Docs are divided into several sections, each covering a different aspect of the project. The docs are structured such that it's intended you read the section above before moving on to the next one. This way, the sections can get more in-depth as you progress through the docs.
