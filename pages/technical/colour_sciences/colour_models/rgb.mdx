# RGB Color Model

The RGB color model is an additive color model used to represent colors in digital displays and devices. It is based on the three primary colors: red (R), green (G), and blue (B).

## How it works

In the RGB color model, colors are created by combining different intensities of red, green, and blue light. Each color component can have a value ranging from 0 to 255, representing the intensity of that color.

By varying the intensity of each color component, we can create a wide range of colors. For example, pure red is represented as (255, 0, 0), pure green as (0, 255, 0), and pure blue as (0, 0, 255).

## Color representation

In digital systems, colors in the RGB color model are typically represented using hexadecimal notation. Each color component is represented by a two-digit hexadecimal number, ranging from 00 to FF. For example, pure red is represented as #FF0000, pure green as #00FF00, and pure blue as #0000FF.

## Color mixing

One of the advantages of the RGB color model is that it allows for easy color mixing. By combining different intensities of red, green, and blue, we can create millions of different colors. For example, mixing equal intensities of red, green, and blue results in white (#FFFFFF), while mixing no intensity of any color results in black (#000000).

## Applications

The RGB color model is widely used in various applications, including digital imaging, computer graphics, web design, and display technologies. It is the primary color model used in computer monitors, televisions, digital cameras, and many other devices.
