# CMYK Color Model

The CMYK color model is a subtractive color model used in color printing. It is based on the four primary colors: cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y), and black (K).

## How it works

In the CMYK color model, colors are created by subtracting different amounts of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink from white light. Each color component can have a value ranging from 0 to 100%, representing the percentage of that color.

By varying the amount of each color component, we can create a wide range of colors. For example, pure cyan is represented as (100%, 0%, 0%, 0%), pure magenta as (0%, 100%, 0%, 0%), pure yellow as (0%, 0%, 100%, 0%), and pure black as (0%, 0%, 0%, 100%).

## Color representation

In color printing, colors in the CMYK color model are typically represented using percentages. Each color component is represented by a percentage value, ranging from 0% to 100%. For example, pure cyan is represented as (100%, 0%, 0%, 0%), pure magenta as (0%, 100%, 0%, 0%), pure yellow as (0%, 0%, 100%, 0%), and pure black as (0%, 0%, 0%, 100%).

## Color mixing

One of the advantages of the CMYK color model is that it allows for easy color mixing. By combining different amounts of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink, we can create millions of different colors. For example, mixing equal amounts of cyan, magenta, and yellow ink results in black, while mixing no ink results in white.

## Applications

The CMYK color model is widely used in color printing, including newspapers, magazines, packaging, and other printed materials. It is the primary color model used in color printers, offset printing presses, and other color printing devices.
