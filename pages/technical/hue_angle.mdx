# Hue Angle

The **Hue Angle** represents the color attribute that distinguishes different colors on the color wheel. It is calculated using the following formula:

$h_{rgb} = \operatorname{atan2}(\sqrt{3}\cdot (G-B),2 \cdot R - G - B )$

where:

- $(R)$, $(G)$, $(B)$ are the red, green, and blue components of the color, respectively.

The hue angle is measured in **degrees** and ranges from 0 to 360. It determines the position of a color on the color wheel, with red at 0 degrees, green at 120 degrees, and blue at 240 degrees.

The hue angle is useful in various applications, such as color manipulation, image processing, and computer graphics.
