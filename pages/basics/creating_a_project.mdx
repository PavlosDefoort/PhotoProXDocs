# Creating A Project

PhotoProX is a **project-based application**. This allows you to keep your changes and edits organized and separate from other projects. To create a new project, click on the **New Project** button in the top right corner of the application. This will open a dialog box where you can enter the name of your project. Once you have entered a name, click the **Create** button to create the project.

## Project Dimensions

When creating a new project, you will be asked to enter the dimensions of the project. This will determine the size of the canvas that you will be working on. You can enter the dimensions in pixels, inches, or millimeters. You can also choose from a list of common preset sizes.

**Note: The dimensions of the project canvas can be changed at any time by clicking on the **Project Settings** button in the top right corner of the application.**

## Does PPI Matter?

The PPI (Pixels Per Inch) is a linear mass density value that describes the **number of pixels per inch**. It can be calculated with the formula:

$\mu = \frac{P}{L}$

where:

- $\mu$ is the PPI
- $P$ is the number of pixels
- $L$ is the length in inches

It is typically stored in the **metadata** of an image file and is used to determine the number of pixels that will be displayed per inch when the image is **printed**.

Despite popular belief, the PPI (Pixels Per Inch) setting of your project **does not matter when working on a digital image**. Although devices, such as phone screens are physical objects with a fixed length and width, these devices already have a built in number of pixels in the screen at the time of manufacturing. This means no matter the value of PPI, the number of pixels per inch on the screen cannot physically change.

This can be further explained by a simple experiment. If you were to create a 100x100 pixel image and set the PPI to 100, and then create another 100x100 pixel image with a PPI of 200, both images will have the **exact same file size** and will look identical on the screen. The only difference will be the metadata of the image file.

The takeaway from this is that **quality of a digital image is defined in the dimensions of the image**, not the PPI. If we go back to the example above, if we changed the resolution of the image to 200x200 pixels, the file size would increase and the image would look better on the screen even if the PPI was set lower than the original image.

If you are printing an image, the PPI setting will matter. In this case, we recommend setting a **PPI of 300 for a minimum for a high quality print**.
