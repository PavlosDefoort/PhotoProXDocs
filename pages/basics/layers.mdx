# Layers

Layers are the building blocks of a PhotoProX project. There are several types of layers, each with its own purpose and functionality. Layers can be added, removed, and reordered in the Layers panel on the right.

## Image Layers

Image layers are the most common type of layer. They are used to display an image on the canvas. You can add an image layer by clicking the "Add Image Layer" button in the Layers panel. You can then select an image file from your computer to add to the layer.

## Adjustment Layers

Adjustment Layers are used to apply changes to the appeareance below them. You can think of them as containers, that contain all the images below them and applies changes to them. Adjustment layers have various types, such as Brightness/Contrast, Hue/Saturation, and more. You can add an adjustment layer by clicking the "Add Adjustment Layer" button in the Layers panel.

## Background Layers

Background Layers are used to set the background color of the canvas. They always have the same dimensions as the canvas and are always at the bottom of the layer stack. Upon creating a new project, a background layer is automatically added to the project. There is no option to add a new background layer since **there can only be one background layer** in a project. However, the hue and opacity of the background layer can be changed in the layer settings.
