# Layers

Layers are the building blocks of a PhotoProX project. There are several types of layers, each with its own purpose and functionality. Layers can be added, removed, and reordered in the Layers panel on the right.

## Image Layers

Image layers are the most common type of layer. They are used to display an image on the canvas. You can add an image layer by clicking the "Add Image Layer" button in the Layers panel. You can then select an image file from your computer to add to the layer.
