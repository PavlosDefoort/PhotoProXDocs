# The Canvas

Every project in PhotoProX has a canvas, which is the area where you can view and edit your images. The canvas is where you will spend most of your time when working on a project. You can zoom in and out of the canvas using the **Zoom In** and **Zoom Out** buttons in the top right corner of the application. You can also pan around the canvas by clicking and dragging with your mouse.
